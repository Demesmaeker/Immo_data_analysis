# immo_data_analysis

The purpose of this code is to clean and analyze datas using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn, and to come to some conclusions.
The datas were scrapped from immoweb the 07/09/2020.

### Who
For this second group project, we were 3 :
- [Vincent Leurs](https://github.com/paradous) 
- [Noah Alvarez Gonzales](https://github.com/NoahAlvarezGonzalez) 
- [Morgane Demesmaeker](https://github.com/Demesmaeker) 


### Methodology
**Cleaning** : the three of us work together, 3 for 1 computer, to get the best of what we can do.
We came up with a kind of menu, to be able to clean only the columns whe were currently working with without a loss of data due to deletions of incomplete/not reliable rows when there is no need. A such, we wera able to work with much more datas, but taking only the ones reliables for what we were doing.
**Analysis** : for this, since there was only two days left, we each took something different to do, so as to have as much analysed datas, and regularly going back together to show/see wat was done, and discuss the following steps.
**Conclusions** : WIP but surely the three of us together.


### Objectives
Use Pandas to manipulate datasets.
Learn and use Matplotlib/Seaborn to show the information

With this chalenge, we proved that we are :
- Able to use Pandas
- Able able to use Data visualisation libraries.(Matplotlib and a bit of Seaborn)
- Able to establish conclusions about a dataset.



### When
- Deadline: 22/09/2020 12:30
- Duration: 3.5 days
- Situation: 2nd month of the BeCode's formation about AI and Machine learning

**Updates**

None for now


### Where
All the work done was made during the BeCode's AI's formation 2020-2021.


### Preview
**Coming soon**


### Progress
**TO BE CONTINUED**
